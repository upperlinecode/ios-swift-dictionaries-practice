//A runner created two arrays to track the days that he ran and the distances that he ran. The distanceArray is listed in the same order as the dateArray


var dateArray: [String] = ["4/3/2015", "4/5/2015", "4/6/2015", "4/7/2015"]
var distanceArray: [Double] = [6, 4, 5.5, 4.5]



//1. Create a dictionary of type [String : Double] called runTracker where the keys are the dates of his workouts and the values are the distances of each workout.





//2. Write a function called displayWorkouts. The function should take in one parameter called workouts of type [String : Double]. The function should print out a list of workouts in a clean format.
//displayWorkouts(runTracker)
//prints:
//   Date   |  Milage
//--------------------
// 4/3/2015 |    6
// 4/5/2015 |    4
// 4/6/2015 |   5.5
// 4/7/2015 |   4.5



//3. Add the following workout to the runTracker dictionary: date: 4/9/2015, distance: 7 miles. The run displayWorkouts again to make sure it was added correctly.



//4. Remove the workout from 4/5/2015



//5. Update the workout from 4/6/2015, giving it a distance of 6 miles
