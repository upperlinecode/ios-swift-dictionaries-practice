//A runner named Brian created two arrays to track the days that he ran and the distances that he ran. The distanceArray is listed in the same order as the dateArray


var dateArray: [String] = ["7/3/2018", "7/5/2018", "7/6/2018", "7/7/2018"]
var distanceArray: [Double] = [6, 4, 5.5, 4.5]



//1. Create a dictionary of type [String : Double] called briansRuns where the keys are the dates of his workouts and the values are the distances of each workout.





//2. Create a second dictionary of the same time called myRuns where you key some dates of your own workouts. If you don't run, that's fine; you can make them up. 




//3. Write a function called displayWorkouts. The function should take in one parameter called workouts of type [String : Double]. The function should print out a list of workouts in a clean format.
//displayWorkouts(workouts: briansRuns)
//prints:
//   Date   |  Milage
//--------------------
// 4/3/2015 |    6
// 4/5/2015 |    4
// 4/6/2015 |   5.5
// 4/7/2015 |   4.5



//4. Confirm that the displayWorkouts function works for ANYONE's running dictionary by calling it with the myRuns dictionary.




//5. Add the following workout to the runTracker dictionary: date: 7/9/2018, distance: 7 miles. The run displayWorkouts again to make sure it was added correctly.



//6. Remove the workout from 7/5/2018.



//5. Update the workout from 7/6/2018, giving it a distance of 6 miles.
